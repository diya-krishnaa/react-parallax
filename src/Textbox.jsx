        The year is 1989.<br/><br/>
        You are a man named Henry who has retreated from your messy life to work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched atop a mountain, it's your job to find smoke and keep the wilderness safe.<br/><br/>
        An especially hot, dry summer has everyone on edge. Your supervisor, a woman named Delilah, is available to youat all times over a small, handheld radio—and is your only contact with the world you've left behind.<br/><br/>
        But when an unsettling mystery lures you out of your lookout tower and into the rugged wilderness below, you'll navigate a wild and untamed landscape, confronting questions—and choices—that could strengthen or shatter the only meaningful connection you have left.
